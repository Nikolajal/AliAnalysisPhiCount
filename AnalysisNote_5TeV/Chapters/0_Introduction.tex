\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
The analysis is performed using pp collisions data at $\sqrt{s}$=\SI{7}{\tera\electronvolt}, collected during the run1 data-taking period with the ALICE detector at the LHC. A detailed description of the ALICE detector can be found here \cite{Collaboration_2008}. In this analysis the $\phi$ mesons are reconstructed using their decay in a Kaon couple of opposite sign, which has a branching ratio of $49.2\%\pm 0.5\%$ \cite{PDG}. The Invariant Mass technique is used for the reconstruction of the mesons, both for inclusive $\phi$ mesons and $\phi$-meson pairs. For the latter a 2D generalisation is required, this will be the topic of section \ref{sec:SignalExtraction}.\\

\subsection{Analysis Summary}
Title of Note: First measurement of $\phi$-pair production in minimum-bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$\SI{7}{\tera\electronvolt}.\\
Objective: This note documents the analysis of $\phi$-meson pairs in minimum-bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$\SI{7}{\tera\electronvolt} which are intended for inclusion in a forthcoming paper.\\
